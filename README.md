# Generative Art
I hope I can establish a good collection of generative art pieces in this repository. The first one I've decided to grow familiar with is a perlin noise flow field, I've added extra functions that makes it less generative due to it's ability to follow your mouse, but I still believe the general approach (setting up a grid of vectors and creating particles to follow the angle of those vectors) still applies as a flow field.

I will be updating this sometime eventually but if you make anything cool be sure to send it over!
